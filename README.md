## Exploring MatplotLib plotting utilities
This project was part of module 4 of research methods course at CDS, IISc. The aim is to explore basic plotting utilities of matplotlib library.
### Software used
- python3.7, jupyter notebook, pandas, matplotlib libraries, git 
### Data source and summary
- I explored publicly available food grain production dataset from https://data.gov.in 
- Specifically, the following link gives distribution of crop produce in Inida. - https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-and-crop-wise-production-foodgrains-2016-17-2019-20-ministry-agriculture-and.
- This dataset gives crop-wise and total food produced in kilotones across different states of India over the period 2016-2020
- Note data corresponding to seasons 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 are incomplete, hence I utilized 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons
### Plots to be generated
- Scatter plot, box plot and bar plot
- Notebook : https://github.com/hariharanrav/Module4_ResearchMethods/blob/master/AnalyzeUnionBudget.ipynb

### Hypothesis 1 : Is the production of food grains increasing over years? 
-  By scatter plotting total production of season 2016-2017 against 2017-2018, the above hypothesis can be verified.
-  Expected positive correlation with slope tilting towards y-axis demonstrating increase in produce over years.
